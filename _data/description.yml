- item: I'm a fullstack web developer and code makes me happy. It's the most amazing thing I have in my life, and I want nothing more than the chance to keep pouring my heart into it.

- item: Non-code things I like include my sweet rescue dog Ash, reading speculative fiction, making guacamole, and napping.

- item: Some quirks:<br>I compulsively say 'bless you' when people cough.<br>I really, REALLY like for code to be properly indented.<br>I have been known to color-code my planner.
