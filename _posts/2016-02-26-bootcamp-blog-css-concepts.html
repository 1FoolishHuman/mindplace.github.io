<p>This is week 3 in Phase 0, and this week we have been introduced to CSS concepts. For me,
this has been a very difficult endeavor, and I spent many hours struggling with translating
my design vision for my site into a minimum viable product via CSS. To wrap up the week,
here's a short discussion about inline vs inline block elements.</p>
<h3 class="headings">What does it mean to display inline vs using inline block?</h3>

      "CSS display: inline vs inline block"</a></i></figcaption><br>
<p>A <b>block</b> element occupies the entire space of its parent
element, and browsers display blocks with newlines before and after them. They do not allow other
elements to sit to their left or right within the parent block. By default, block elements
begin on a newline. Block elements can have a set height and width.</p>
<p><b>Inline-block</b> elements, by contrast, have no linebreaks before or after, and can sit next to
other elements within its parent element. <b>Inline-block</b> elements are still blocks, however, and therefore
can have a set height and width.</p>
<p><b>Inline</b> elements, like inline-blocks, can sit next to other elements within its parent element,
but unlike blocks, <b>inline</b> elements cannot take a set height or width.</p>
<p>So we can say that an <b>inline-block</b> element behaves as an <b>inline</b> element, but retains
its <b>block</b> qualities by having a set width and height. <b>Inline</b> elements can float;
<b>inline-block</b> elements float by default, and are considered to float in a better way than
having it be explicitly defined, because the old method of defining a float meant the float had to be cleared for
elements that came after the floating element.</p>
