title:  "Deadline counter"

<p>I wanted to spend a bit of time getting familiarized with the built-in <code>Date</code> and <code>Time</code>
classes, so I decided to build a deadline counter that counted the days left until a given deadline. After requiring <code>Date</code>
and spending some time browsing its methods, I realized it would be easy to create a new deadline date by calling
<code>Date.new</code> and passing it the arguments year, month, and day. My method turned out to be a lot shorter than I anticipated,
which I think really speaks to the awesome built-ins that Ruby ships with:</p>

<p>Nevertheless I was a bit taken aback by how easy that turned out to be, so I decided to kick it up a notch and write another
deadline counter: student edition! When the clock starts ticking, students don't think in terms of days as much as hours. For that, I needed to rely more on the <code>Time</code>
class. Here it is:</p>

<p>A bit longer, this one! Still, Ruby built-ins made the logic simple. The only extra came
when I realized I needed to create a helper method <code>military</code> to change hours into military time for the
<code>deadline_hour_counter</code> method.</p>
