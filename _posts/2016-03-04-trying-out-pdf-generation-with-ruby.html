    <p>I'm not sure where I came accross the thought, but at some point it occured to me
    that if Ruby is able to generate text files so easily, and Rails apparently generates
    HTML files via 'views', why wouldn't Ruby be able to generate other kinds of files?
    I looked around a bit and found that there are quite a few nifty gems for PDF generation
    with a Ruby script. Here's one I tried out: <a href="https://github.com/pdfkit/PDFKit">PDFKit</a>.</p>
    I found it from reading <a href="http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2010/06/15/rethinking-pdf-creation-in-ruby">"Rethinking
      PDF Creation in Ruby"</a>. It depends primarily on <a href="http://wkhtmltopdf.org/">wkhtmltopdf</a>, a gem that
      generates PDFs with Ruby from HTML/CSS files or URLs (which is super cool).</p>

    <object data="/assets/blog/page.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="400px"><p>Wow. That was easier than I thought.
    This turned out to not be a big project after all, and I got to make something cool while getting some practice in
    using gems, too. I was excited to see how easy it was
    to generate PDFs by simply passing in my files. <a href="../imgs/page.pdf">Click here</a>
     to view the Google pdf page I generated by passing the program a URL instead of an HTML file.</p>
