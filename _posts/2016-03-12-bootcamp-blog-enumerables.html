<p>This is Week 5 of DBC, and this week we did a Ruby group project with our accountability
groups where each person had a role and corresponding problems to solve for their role. Role 4
was to write an array_deletion_method and a hash_deletion_method, both of those being bang methods.
Here's how Christyn Budzyna and I solved it: </p>

<p>Then today, I happened to read the
<a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/guide-ruby-collections-iii-enumerable-enumerator/">"Guide
to Ruby Collections III: Enumerable and Enumerator"</a> article that Emmanuel posted, which mentioned
a very intesting method that I have only hazily seen before, and that primarily in the context of
CLI: the <code>grep</code> method.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Enumerable.html#method-i-grep">Enumerable#grep</a>,
<code>grep</code> iterates over the collection object it is called on and returns an array
of values which belong to the same case (<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Object.html#method-i-3D-3D-3D">===</a>)
as the given pattern:<br><code>["a", 1, "b"].grep(String)</code> => <code>["a", "b"]</code>.</p>
<p>So to illustrate, here's our <code>my_array_deletion_method!</code> with <code>grep</code>:</p>

<p>8 lines down to 2, not bad!</p>
