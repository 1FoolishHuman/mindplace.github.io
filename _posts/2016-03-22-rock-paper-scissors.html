<p>I've looked at some tutorials on making small games with JavaScript and it seems
that you could make a JavaScript game run in the browser with basically nothing more
than some HTML. That's pretty nifty. I don't feel ready for that conceptual leap though yet,
maybe tomorrow. Today, as part of my self-challenges to get my JavaScript up to code (ahem),
here's a lovely Rock-Paper-Scissors game.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/a7fb6705d7a88acc10ef.js"></script>
<p>I've understood that JavaScript objects can function like hashes in Ruby,
with accessibility and everything. And using for loops works fine for accessing them iteratively.
But I miss my Ruby string interpolation.</p>
