<p>Whew! Just finished it! This is a little command-line game in JavaScript that
generates a castle and, over the next '5 days', has random potential denizens show up, who
do or do not end up staying for good. If enough good additions stay in the castle, the user
wins&mdash;else, the user gets rudely booted from their castle, never to return! Here's some sample
output:</p>

<p>The most difficult issue I had to overcome with this game was the fact that JavaScript (for
very good reasons) doesn't have the kind of sleep functionality that I've come to rely on with
Ruby. I had to find a workaround on StackOverflow which I do not think I would be able to
write myself at this point. Additionally, the other thing that gave me trouble was generating
random numbers, especially those in a specific range. This was a frustrating exercise in
trying to get the <code>Math.random()</code> to output something I actually was able to use, as
opposed to a decimal.

<p>Enough griping! Here's the code!</p>
