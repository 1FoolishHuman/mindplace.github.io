<p> Working with the Fibonacci sequence is really enjoyable as it is
  not bad to do either recursively or iteratively. And having to do it in JS was not painful. Here's
  one in JavaScript that generates Fibonacci numbers while the length of the sequence array does not equal the
  given required length:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/deb13ac6c015c8b3a4e1.js"></script>
<p>And a similarly formed algorithm for determining if a given number is a Fibonacci number:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/918c6e3d87a28c484da4.js"></script>
<p>Here's the same solution in Ruby:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/57fb6100245cfbdfd979.js"></script>
<p>Those are all iterative solutions. I think recursive solutions are also lovely!</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/b7711feface611ad7082.js"></script>
<p>Except that my solution is, if anything, a line or two longer than the iterative one. So this
  wouldn't be even a conceptually better or neater solution and since it takes more memory,
  it'll remain just an exercise.</p>
