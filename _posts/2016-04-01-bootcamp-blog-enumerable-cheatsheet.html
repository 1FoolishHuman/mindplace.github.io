<p>Today's post is a cheatsheet I did for week 8 of Dev Bootcamp. We're coming up quickly
now onto Phase1, the intense on-campus immersive phase, and we're all preparing ourselves
and our Ruby skills for that. This week was an introduction to SQL and some work in
JavaScript, Ruby, and HTML/CSS. Here's the page I made, see it yourself <a href="http://mindplace.github.io/static-pages/cheat-sheet/enumerable-cheatsheet">here</a>.

<p>I struggled for a very long time with the footer. I couldn't figure out how to have
  it stick to the bottom even if the page contents weren't enough to push it there naturally.
  In the end I couldn't figure it out and I shrugged my shoulders and fixed the rest of it
  to my liking. I'm going to bring it up to a friend at bootcamp who has CSS experience.
  In the meantime, I'm enjoying my other design choices.
