title: Avoiding N+1 Queries
layout: post

## The concept

## The talk 
Check out the [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/EstherLeytush/avoiding-n1-errors-in-rails-apps) on Slideshare, and the [repository](https://github.com/mindplace/n_plus_one_blog) on Github. The code is in 2 branches: the master branch is the app without being optimized to avoid N+1 queries, while the `eager-loading` branch is optimized and meant as a contrast.
