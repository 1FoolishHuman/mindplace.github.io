    <h3 class="headings">March 16, 2016</h3>

    <p>Classes in Ruby--and other languages--are a way of organizing objects into mini code-factories:
    where the class itself is a template that gets filled out for each copy, or instance, of itself. A great
    real-world explanation of classes is in role-playing games where at the beginning you create your own character
    (and credit for this thought goes to the
    <a href="http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2014/12/02/why-is-object-oriented-programming-useful-with-an-role-playing-game-example/">Invent With Python</a> blogger).
    Your character will belong to a class--it'll be a Warrior, or a Druid, or a Healer, etc--but it will be unique
    to you, because it will have a name that you give it, and other information like special clothes that it wears
    because you decided on them, etc. Based on its class, your character will also have its own behaviours: it will
    be able to heal other characters if it's a Healer, or talk to plants if it's a Druid, or kick some serious butt
    if it's a Warrior, etc, and for the most part, these special behaviours will not be available to characters from
    other classes.</p>
    <p>Similarly, a Ruby class has state--attributes like name, etc--and behaviours--methods that instances of itself
    can execute. We can think of attributes as things that describe the object and give it an identity from other
    instances of that class: it'll have its own name, for example. So attributes are things that that instance of the
    class IS, and its methods are things that it DOES.</p>
    <p>When a copy of the class is taken to create a new instance of that class, it is given its own
    state/attributes. To illustrate, here's a Book class:</p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/90dd6d9af6dd59ede721.js"></script>
    <p>Books in the real world aren't meant to DO anything on their own (not that that stops them from being
    powerful forces...), but they are certainly meant to have unique attributes: their own title and author, for example.
    In the example above, the class Book is a set of code that, when a copy of itself is made and given a title and
    an author, will be a unique Book object.</p>
    <p>The methods <code>title</code> and <code>author</code> expose the values
    contained inside the instance variables <code>@title</code> and <code>@author</code> respectively. (Instance
    variables are variables that are expressely there to hold values for a specific instance of that class: they are
    available anywhere inside the class to give their value or to have that value altered.) Using <code>attr_reader</code>,
    we can abstract away those simple <code>title</code> and <code>author</code> methods into the following:
    <code>attr_reader :title, :author</code>, which under the hood is exactly what those little methods are, just
    differently written. Here's the Book class updated to use <code>attr_reader</code>:</p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/8fe4ba7674eda3e8d828.js"></script>
    <p>Looks like the parts inside <code>initialize</code> changed too! Like <code>attr_reader</code>,
    writing variable assignments like this is just a shorter, one-line way of doing the same thing as before.</p>
    <p>Now let's make a Library class:</p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/ee370d161d1cc016b224.js"></script>
    <p>Our Library class is a little more complex than our Book class. Our Library class has methods that allow it to
    DO stuff, not just BE stuff: it can <code>add_book</code> into itself, it can <code>suggest_a_book</code> to the
    user, and it can <code>suggest_an_author</code> too. Don't focus too much on the code inside <code>add_book</code>
    just yet, we'll get to it in a moment. Right now, let's make a new Library object, and ask it to show itself to us
    using <code>p</code>:</p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/416ee67f221a09f8036d.js"></script>
    <p>That's a very interesting bit of code right there in the comments: when we asked <code>my_library</code>
    to show itself to us, it printed out that long string of characters. The first part is clear: it's telling us
    what class it belongs to. The next bit of numbers is its object ID; and that last part, the <code>@books=[]</code>, is its
    attribute <code>books</code>, which we said is empty when we first initialize our Library. (Since
    all libraries start out empty at first and get filled up with books over time.) So now, let's add some books
    to our library using the <code>add_book</code> method:</p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/82acb8ab901326ea1a85.js"></script>
    <p>So before, our library had an empty array for <code>@books</code> attribute: but now it's filled with 4 Book objects, each
    with their own attributes of <code>@title</code> and <code>@author</code>! This is because the Library method <code>add_book</code>
    takes two arguments, title and author, and uses those arguments to create a new Book object each time it is called;
    then it "shovels" the new Book object as a whole--including its object ID and everything else about it, like its
    attributes--into the <code>@books</code> array.</p>
    <p>It's a bit hard to read those long indecipherable object strings. Let's ask it to show us its books in a nicer
    way:</p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/0ae344719e4c9ae1b475.js"></script>
    <p>That's much nicer! <code>@books</code> holds the value of an array of objects, and the array method <code>each</code>
    allows us to iterate over <code>@books</code> and ask each book object to put itself to the console in the way we've
    specified.</p>
    <p>Now let's try out its rather pushy <code>suggest_a_book</code> and <code>suggest_an_author</code> methods:</p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/7d0358f4b83fbddc1f4a.js"></script>
    <p>Super nifty! That's all for today, I'm feeling like opening up my copy of <i>The Well Grounded Rubyist</i> now.</p>
