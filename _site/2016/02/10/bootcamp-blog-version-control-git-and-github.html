<b>What are the benefits of version control?</b> Version control makes it possible for developers
to generate a history of their projects or project files in a way that allows them to return to a
previous point in that history. Version control also allows developers to make copies of the master
file(s) in order to make changes or additions without breaking the master code and interrupting
potential user experience. Version control makes it possible for developers to share the creation process
with other developers or support individuals, by allowing everyone to have a distinct
copy or version of the code or project. This is all made possible by the fact that version control
systems are designed to
easily merge changes and updates. This can decentralize project control to some extent, but primarily in
positive ways: by not forcing a single person or a small group of people to be solely responsible
and liable for the integrity of the master file(s), by not interrupting the use of the current project
in order to add features, and by ensuring that there is a single master file that is fully up-to-date
and as bug-free as possible.
</p>
<p>
<b>How does git help you keep track of changes?</b> git helps developers keep track of changes in that it is
a widely available and acessible command line-based version control program. Initializing git
in any folder and following file saving workflows&mdash;committing changes and keeping files and versions
consistent&mdash;allows developers to generate an ongoing history of the project. This fantastic visibility
on changes helps projects stay pertinent, ongoing, and easily updateable. git is arguably the
most well-used version control system on local computers, because it is powerful, simple, reliable, and
doesn't discriminate against file formats.
</p>
<p>
<b>Why use GitHub to store your code?</b> Github is a clouded&mdash;non-local, Internet-accessible, remote&mdash;
service that syncs up with your local computer and git-initialized folders to allow you to store and
create files and repositories in the cloud. This really quadruples the functionality git offers
developers by making it possible to share repositories and files across various computers and with
collaborators or team members. Github allows users with the appropriate permissions to view, fork (copy),
and pull (store) code and folders to their Github accounts and local computers. Because it makes
syncing code so simple and functional, Github is the world's leading store of Open Source projects.
