    <p>This is a Ruby project from <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/">Jumpstart Labs</a>.
  I wanted to try building something to work on what I have learned: dynamic classes, IO,
  parsing data. The MicroBlogger tutorial seemed like it was right up my alley
  and was going to do something interesting and useful, too. Plus it gave me a chance to
  work with gems, something I've only ever done with RSpec before.</p>

<p>It turned out to be a ton of fun. Using the <code>jumpstart_auth</code> gem felt like magic: I could
  ask it for things like a friend's last tweet and it would deliver it!</p>
<p>I think my focus for this project, as much as it has been in the past, is the fluid
  flow between user interface and program. It is important to me that I build things that make
  sense under the hood in a way that keeps user needs at a forefront. In this case it meant
  thinking of basic design and additional features as modules that fit together but were also
  distinct from each other.</p>
<p>I think the two most important things I've gotten to know better because of this project
  is the experience of using a gem and checking out its features, and the use and value of
  Ruby's <code>respond_to?</code> and <code>send</code> methods. Those were really useful in making the user interface
  code short and very easy to add more commands for the user and more modular-designed services
  in the program. Here's the user interface:</p>
