    <p>This was a project to add a feature to my <a href="/2016/02/16/microblogger.html">MicroBlogger</a> client.
  It uses the Bitly gem to shorten links automatically by recognizing 'http' and 'www'. Here's
  the code:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/3bbe7bfa9193eed87e76.js"></script>
<p>This was its own little challenge. First I had to understand why Bitly.new required two
arguments, and after a bit of researching realized those were the API authenticators, so I
set up my own. Then, because I'm rusty, I forgot that <code>select</code> returns an array; I kept having errors
because I tried to feed Bitly the urls as an array. Then there was the
challenge of having multiple urls in a tweet because I only realized
belatedly that this wouldn't support having more than one url in a tweet.</p>
<p>Finally I had a problem when I didn't realize that the gem couldn't recognize
a link if it didn't come with 'http' or 'https' in front of it, so I had to
fix that.</p>
<p>It took time to work through each bug, but it was all worth it to see the bitly-shortened link popping up in my
Twitter feed.</p>
