<p>I've gone through a few good resources on bash/shell commands,
trying to get comfortable with the command line interface, but I wasn't
quite feeling comfortable still. One of my Dev Bootcamp guides suggested that
I try writing a shell script as a way to get a bit better. So I wrote one that
checks first for whether it's been passed any arguments. If it doesn't get any,
it prints out instructions for the user; if it does get some, it checks whether each
argument is a software that is installed, and prints out whatever it finds.</p>
<p>There were a few stuggles and a few very interesting moments with this project.
For one thing, I already knew a bit about <code>ARGV</code>s and could assume that a shell script
could recognize and iterate over an array. I also assumed that there was some way
to create a conditional flow. Both of these assumptions helped a lot with googling for the commands.
I found <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_07_01.html">this
awesome resource</a> and used it as a command cheatsheet. I decided to use this one
to test if <code>ARGV</code>s were empty:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/bash-command.jpg"></p>
<p>That's where my confusion, still unresolved, comes in. I passed it <code>$@</code>, or
what I understand is the <code>ARGV</code> array, and expected that <code>[ -s $@ ]</code> would fail because
an empty array does not have a size greater than zero. But instead it works, and prints
the following instructions only if the ARGV array has a size equal to zero! So I remain
confused.</p>
<p>Still it did the trick&mdash;writing this script definitely helped me get greater
confidence with writing shell commands! And I now have a much deeper respect and
appreciation for Unix...</p>
