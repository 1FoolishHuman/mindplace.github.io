      <p>One of the things
  I've had to do on the road towards Ruby competency
    has been to write my own versions of array methods from scratch.
    I ended up reusing them quite often before I realized that the classes
    I was making could be subsumed into Array or Hash or whatnot as
    required...but at least I got lots of experience. </p>
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/0016c54fd8310495b2df11d475e08ab4.js"></script>
  <p>In order to write these, I had to think from a very different
  perspective: one of creation moreso than use. I had to think in terms
  of future use of this code, rather than trying to get it to produce
  something for me in the moment. That was a really interesting and important
  conceptual switchover for me, and I hope I keep it, because it
  feels more rigorous.</p>
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/b1db4e6e441846254d39ba1631a8a685.js"></script>
  <p>It was a huge struggle to conceptualize how these methods worked under the hood, and I had
  to strengthen both my knowledge of Procs and self in order to do
  it. </p>

  <p>Writing out <code>my_each</code> was the biggest hurdle; after that, I could
  piggy-back off of it to write <code>my_map</code>, <code>my_select</code>, and <code>my_inject</code> methods.</p>
  <p>Next hurdle will be to write out all the different kinds of sorting
  algorithms. Computer Science 101, but for me, it will probably be a revelation.</p>
