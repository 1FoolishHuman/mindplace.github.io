    <p>Today's entry in my sorting algorithm series
is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">quicksort</a>. This is divide-and-conquer
sort that relies on partitioning elements and sorting them based on whether they are larger
or smaller than a chosen pivot. Depending on whether the pivot is already a median in the
array, its average runtime is O(n*log(n)) and is considered one of the most popular
sorting algorithms as a result of its speed and low memory usage (O(log(n)) on average), even
though it is considered an unstable sort. It is not really a good choice for nearly-sorted
data, however, because poor pivot choices in those cases can lead to a runtime of O(n^2).</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/8530df7c15e92845d744.js"></script>
<p>I struggled with this algorithm until I understood that it really does rest entirely
on partitioning. I thought at first I could write two methods for this, one to hold the basic
program and one to partition sub-arrays, but when I started working on the helper method,
I tried my hand at making it recursive, and it worked.</p>
<p>A bug that I didn't catch originally though was one that I only realized to look for
after I started reading about a different quicksort form, the one that makes 3 partitions
instead of 2, where the 3rd holds items whose values are equal to the pivot. When I read
about that version of the algorithm, I realized that my version doesn't preserve
duplicates, so I added the third partition. Not sure if this still counts as the standard
quicksort with this change, but hey, at least I caught a major bug.</p>
<p>Recursion is another difficult concept for me, and this algorithm really helped
me strengthen my grasp of it. I debugged with <code>puts</code> to see how the recursion was
working, and it showed me that it kept drilling down smaller and smaller partitions until
it was told to stop, then trickled up all those values fully ordered.</p>
<p>My concern with this algorithm was that it doesn't seem to have sorted
the array in place, instead taking copies of array slices to work off of.
At some point I want to write a program that reviews all my algorithms and tests
their runtimes, to see if the way I wrote them approaches the runtimes that they
are supposed to evaluate to. </p>
<p>In terms of sorting algorithms, this is my second-to-last post, as I've written
sorts from nearly all the different groups: simple sorts (insertion and selection),
efficient sorts (merge and quicksort), and bubble sorts (my basic bubble sort). Final
group is the distribution sorts, like counting sort or bucket sort. After that I'll
have to move on to other topics to learn more about data structures.</p>
