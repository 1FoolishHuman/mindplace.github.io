    <p>I made a little mock-up for my tea site a few weeks ago
and finally sat down to make it. But of course in the time between then and now, my ideas
and design taste changed, and I was thoroughly motivated to learn about how to use options like
<code>float</code>, <code>display: inline-block;</code>, and most of all, <code>box-sizing: border-box</code>.
The site's HTML and CSS is <a href="https://github.com/mindplace/static-pages">here</a>, see
the site for yourself <a href="http://mindplace.github.io/static-pages/tea-site/tea-site">here</a>.
<p><img src="/assets/blog/middle-tea.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>Somewhere in the depths of the night, in a sugar-fueled haze, I decided I wanted pretty images
to grace my page, and floating images just by themselves, altering with text, wasn't at all
the effect I wanted. So I found <a href="canva.com">Canva</a>, a site that lets you mix text, images.
and shapes to make nice pleasing visual elements that look completely at home on someone's
Facebook feed. Here's my favorite one that I made:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/bottom-tea.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>Quite right, Alice.</p>
<p>(On a nerdy note, I chose that quote because it read like an array joke.)</p>
<p>The top and bottom of the page gave me a chance to work on headers and footers that stick to the top and
bottom respectively and stretch the full width of the page. I think the footer turned out to be my favorite
element:</p>
<p>The site isn't responsive, the items are really gigantic on my screen and take up a lot of
space generally, and the whole experience of it doesn't feel cohesive, but it was a great, really great
learning experience. I learned about making the navbar in a way that has the floating right element
positioned inside the rest of the floating left elements, which was really not at all intuitive. I learned about
visual design, a topic I really can't say I have much fondness for. I learned more than I think I could stomach
about floating elements and trying to make them align.</p>
<p>The next step would be to learn about JavaScript and embedding some nice code to have that test work.
