    <p>I daresay I was a typical academic in my time in academia: that is to say, the absentminded kind.
So when I graduated with a Masters degree in Renaissance and Early Modern Studies, I hadn't published
any papers. (That itself was probably the first signal to me that I wasn't going to be continuing down
that path.) But I was and remain pretty proud of the works I had completed. Now I may found a way to sorta
publish and at the same time have it be a learning experience on my road towards mastering the skills
I need to break into web development.</p>
<p>Here's one I wrote on Sir John Mandeville, a guy who published a
wonderful little book of travels through the Middle East which happened to include lots of people with dog-heads,
Anthropophagi, ladies and dragons, and any number of other kinds of interesting things. The book
was a crazy bestseller for something like 400 years before finally falling into disrepute (because,
you know, sometime around 1730 they finally started saying that maybe there was a chance that this wasn't a factual
account). The paper I featured on this one-page site project was
about how Mandeville's book was being read during the Early Modern period in England (about 1620 - 1680),
when there was still plenty of debate on whether this was a factual book or not.</p>

<p>I spent a good 5 hours putting this one-page site together (although most of that time was probably
spent in trying to get the citations to show up properly...#AcademiaProblems) and it looks
just about exactly as I envisioned it. The CSS and HTML is <a href="https://github.com/mindplace/static-pages">here</a>. See the site for yourself <a href="http://mindplace.github.io/static-pages/mandeville-site/mandeville">here</a>.</p>

<p>I got plenty of chances to work on <code>aside</code> tags and positioning things with <code>inline-block</code>,
<code>float: left;</code>, and as many borders and margins as my heart could desire.</p>
<p>But to be honest, this project was almost completely inspired by finally discovering RGBA:
specifically, discovering that I could set a background color's opacity. I had tried to do something similar for this site
overall a few weeks ago, and found it impossible, so discovering RGBA was extremely exciting.</p>
