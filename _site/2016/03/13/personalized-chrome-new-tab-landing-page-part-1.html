    <p>While reading an interesting Lifehacker article about
<a href="http://lifehacker.com/start-me-offers-customizable-start-pages-you-can-use-in-1762960188">
  customizable start-up pages</a>, it occured to me that I could try making my own. A few minutes
later, armed with <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Developing-a-Custom-Newtab-Page-For-Google-Chrome/">this
awesome little tutorial</a>, I jumped into crafting
my own new-tab/landing page.</p>
<p>This was one of the most exciting projects I've ever worked on
because it is so useful to me right now. Building it felt faster, easier, and more personal than any HTML & CSS I've
worked on to date. All I had to do was sketch up for myself what I wanted my page to have and how it would roughly look,
then I jumped into the HTML and built it out. The HTML and CSS is <a href="https://github.com/mindplace/chrome-newtab-page">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/new-tab-screenshot.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>After finishing the HTML and CSS, I just had to find myself a 128x128 pixel icon, and put together what seems to be my first JSON script:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/4e8e158be802d08ba8d4.js"></script>
<p>I put all the files into a folder and uploaded it to chrome://extensions page by clicking "Load
unpacked extension". Seeing this made me so very happy:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/ext-screenshot.png" max-width="100%"></p>
<p>And that was it! Part 2 will be to see if I can turn this into an actual extension for Chrome so that it doesn't have to
keep loading from my desktop.</p>
