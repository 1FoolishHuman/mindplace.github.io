    <p>I was rereading Paul Ford's amazing essay <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/">"What Is Code?"</a>
yesterday when it mentioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm">Euclid's algorithm</a>,
one of the oldest algorithms still commonly in use today. It is a way to find the GCD of two numbers (greatest common divisor) and it does it like so:</p>

<p class="highlight-text">
1. Take 2 numbers<br>
2. The greater number modulo the smaller number equals the remainder<br>
3. If the remainder is not 0, the smaller number becomes the new greater number and remainder becomes the new smaller number<br>
4. Do steps 1 - 3 for as many times as you need to in order to get a remainder that is equal to 0<br>
5. At that point, return the most recent smaller number.</p>


<p>I appreciated the recursive nature of this lovely little algorithm and decided to
try it out and practice my recursion skills, all at the same time:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/8fde7031305c98b6bcde.js"></script>
<p>It can still be shortened, but it's short enough and simple enough already so
why make it complicated by trying to oversimplify? The only issue I ran into was that
I wasn't clear on which number I was supposed to return, but after rewatching
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJn843kplDw">this visual tutorial</a> everything eventually clicked for me.</p>
