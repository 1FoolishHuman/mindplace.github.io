    <p>We've started Week 7 in Dev Bootcamp, and it's all JavaScript all day. I've never seen or touched
any JavaScript before, so it's all been new to me, but I've been enjoying the fact that really, so very
much of what I've already learned thanks to working with Ruby transfers fairly nicely, just as I was
told. I'm trying to get myself to a place where I'm comfortable, so I set myself a bunch of small
assignments to complete in addition to the coursework. Today's delightful dev duo&mdash;Ruby and JS&mdash;present
FizzBuzz.</p>
<p>I've written FizzBuzz before when I found <a href="">RubyQuiz</a> and after hearing about it in various
places:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/e3f4b48ba8d2fbc398ed.js"></script>
<p>And now, for the JavaScript version:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/d05b280f97286e327f8c.js"></script>
Much more chunky-clunky. So far it seems that, compared to what I'm used to with Ruby,
JS is a dynamic but clunky language that's hacked together and needs workarounds for things
like sorting numerical items. Writing it feels like I'm tying things together with string,
and neither those things nor the string nor I like it. But that feeling of competence, of
being able to make little programs already is amazing. Thanks to the essential concepts I've
learned with Ruby, I am starting to believe that it really might all make more sense from here
onwards.
