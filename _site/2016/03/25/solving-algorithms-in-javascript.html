    <p>Working through another set of small algorithmic challenges in order to bootstrap my JavaScript
  literacy! Today's problems include a pretty long solution to finding the mode in a given array,
  and the Look-Say sequence.</p>
<p><b>Mode.</b> This problem gave me, well, problems. I used a JavaScript object like a hash to
  store values, but getting them back was messy as I'm still unused to the syntax. In the end
  it was a long, drawn-out affair in three parts: generating a hash of the given numbers with their
  respective counts, determining the element with the highest count, and generating a new array
  containing the numbers whose counts were equal to the highest count.</p>
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/b30f04954bd02bbd9ee6.js"></script>
<p><b>Look-Say Sequence.</b> The idea for this one is for the program to look at a given number,
  extract it from the series, and record how many times it is repeated. So the number 1 returns
  11, because there was one 1 in the original number; the number 338862222 returns two 3s, two 8s,
  one 6, and four 2s, or 23281642.</p>
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/3877aa922f0c537b5c3e.js"></script>
<p>Doing these kinds of algorithms all week has really helped me to get comfortable with JavaScript,
  I think. It's how I initially learned Ruby: first learn enough syntax to solve algorithms, then
  solve a whole bunch of them, then read textbooks to understand what is happening and what else
  I should think about to start building on top of the small but stable amount of knowledge that I
  have. I read somewhere about a dev who has a series of go-to challenges for solving when learning
  new languages, and although I originally thought that something like that wouldn't be enough, now
  it feels a bit different.</p>
