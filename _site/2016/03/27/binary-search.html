    <p>Moving on to writing my own binary search seemed like it made sense after spending time with
  sorting algorithms, but it turned out to be tougher than I expected. The essential concept
  of how binary search works, thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhciTuD3E8">this video</a> made plenty of sense;
  the difficulty was to not just locate a given item in a sorted list, but to actually return
  its original location.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/d9bda84fffb63271e967.js"></script>
<p>The difficulty started with the fact that I initially designed my algorithm in a way where
  it took ever smaller slices of the given array, bounded by either the first item and the midpoint
  item, or the midpoint item and the last item, in the last iteration of the slice. This meant that
  finding the item was easy, but the only location for it would be its location in the final slice,
  not the original array. That made my whole algorithm pretty pointless, in my mind. So I redesigned
  it to keep count of how many items before and after the current slice I had chopped off. And after
  many tweaks, that worked out.</p>
