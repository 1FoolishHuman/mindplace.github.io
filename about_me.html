      <br />
		  <p>Hi, I'm Esther, and I love Ruby.</p>
  	 	<p>I'm a <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/locations/new-york/">Dev Bootcamp</a> student and I live in Brooklyn, NY.</p>
		  <p>I did my undergraduate and master's degrees in English literature and identify as a lifetime reader (but definitely not an academic). My 
		  favorite types of books are fantasy and scifi, but I spend most of my reading time these days reading and thinking about Zen practices,
		  mind-hacking (as in self-improvement), and minimalism.</p>
		  <p>Other than reading, there are many things I love: like making tiny art (<a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/briarthorn?ref=hdr_shop_menu">and
		  even trying to sell some of it</a>), cooking, going to Renaissance faires in full costume, and spending time with my family and my dog, Ash. 
		    (To wit: Exhibit 1 is on the left.)</p>
		    <p>A quirk about me is my overwhelming love of puns. No matter how bad they might be, I always think 
		    they're just so punny.</p>
		    <p>The best thing about my life is that I'm going to spend my entire career working with code, and
		    that feels overwhelmingly joyful. Having found something so awesome and challenging--and some days, downright
		    magical--to which to dedicate the best of me is a gift that I didn't know I would ever recieve. </p>
