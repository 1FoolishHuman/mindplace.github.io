2.7 Blog Setup reflection

My wireframe: https://github.com/mindplace/mindplace.github.io/tree/master/blog/imgs/wireframe-blogs.jpg

I had a really great time pairing today. This was the first pairing session either of us have had and I think we both were 
pretty nervous and unsure throughout the experience, which I think was actually helpful because it made us polite, 
careful, and taking one step at a time. My partner was easy to work with for me because it seemed like we had similar 
work paces and idea of what a navigator vs driver do. We agreed to do the first half of the wireframing separately 
but actually talked a lot about it anyway and gave input into each others' wireframes. Then we decided I would drive
and he would navigate in us creating the html for his page, and then we would switch and he would drive and I 
navigate for my page. This worked fine for us and I don't think we experienced any hitches. Afterwards we shared our code 
through chat and spent a minute reflecting on the session, which was really lovely. I think this worked for us and I
hope I'll be working with that partner again. 

QUESTIONS

[How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?] 
It was interesting. It was slower to do than it would have been if I did it on my own because I had to 
wait for someone else to type my ideas out, but it was 
much more coherent because we had to plan out how we were going to write out our HTML before we actually
put hands to keyboard. 

[Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?] 
Very, very much so. It really helped solidify how I want my site to look before diving into 
creating the different page elements. 

[What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?] 
We basically both agreed that a good wireframe should include the date of the blog post and links to 
social media and homepages. We didn't discuss this but I think based on what our wireframes looked 
like we both were interested in minimalistic design.

[What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?] 
I relearned that images should go inside a href tags if the image itself should link somewhere!
