    <p>Engagement is a quality best expressed as a collection of traits such as initiative,
      big-picture thinking, inclination towards execution, and reliability. An engaged person
      at work is someone you can be sure will respond to your question, reach out to help you with
      a problem, and listen closely when you're talking.</p>

    <p>They won't refer you to someone else unless they really can't help you. They won't tell you
      "that's not my job" if you give them an assignment that doesn't correlate word for word with
      their job description. They won't search for a reason why something won't work before attempting
      to recognize how that something might work. They routinely assume that if they ask questions,
      they'll eventually get answers. They stay open to better, more effective, more efficient, even
        more interesting ways to get work done. They get excited by responsibility because they recognize
      new things as opportunities to add value.</p>

    <p><b>Here's your roadmap:</b></p>

    <p>Examine your current idea of your job description. If you're like any of the millions of
      white-collar workers experiencing ambiguity in their roles (meaning, if you can't define what
      you are supposed to be doing at work) get excited by this discovery. All areas of ambiguity mean
      a chance to create more or own more control.</p>

    <p><b>1. Commit yourself to curiosity.</b> Here's a common scenario. Someone sends an email asking you and
      your other teammates a question or passing along a problem. No one responds because no one knows
      who's in charge of this new ambiguous issue. Everyone assumes that it's not their responsibility.</p>

    <p>This is your moment, because you can choose to engage with the problem. Even if you are not empowered
      to deal with the problem yourself, you can still ask questions of your colleagues and superiors,
      follow up with the person asking for information or anyone who says they will look into it, and
      generally watch over the issue until it is resolved. You'll be surprised how often someone taking
      an interest in an ambiguous question becomes the person everyone recognizes as the go-to person
      for it after that.</p>

    <p><b>2. Start noticing which job processes, especially cross-department processes, are ambiguous or don't
      actually belong to a specific person.</b> Then start investigating: ask your colleagues and managers
      questions, especially those in connection with those projects or processes, read what you can find,
      and consider what passes across your own sphere of influence. Expand your sphere of influence a little.
      If there are no objections, expand it further. Discuss it with your manager by explaining your research
      and your vision for the future. Ask outright for ownership of the issue.</p>

    <p><b>3. Jump on opportunities to engage.</b> Did someone ask you to do something new? Something outside the
      scope of your known responsibilities? Say yes! Did your manager outline a problem area? Find time to
      talk to them to outline ideas for dealing with the problem, and ask to implement solutions.</p>

    <p><b>4. Go above and beyond.</b> In everyday processes, can you guess your colleagues' or managers' work needs?
      Can you think of new ways to meet user or client needs that you are suddenly noticing? Can you think of
      someone to talk with about brainstorming ideas for meeting these needs? Schedule that meeting, take that
      initiative, expand your role to include that responsibility.</p>

    <p><b>5. Stay playful.</b> Remember that growth and change happen best if you are lighthearted. You cannot be
      afraid for your job while you're trying out this new way of seeking to add value, because you have to
      feel free to be curious, explore, try new things, and make mistakes. If you are still afraid for your
      job but wish to try this, accept your fear, take a deep breath, and set it aside. Treat it as a signal
      telling you something is wrong, determine what that wrongness is, outline everything you can possibly
      do to allay it, do what you can, and then relax--everything else is beyond your control.</p>

    <p>The work and services you provide are always more important than who you are as a person. Therefore
      don't demand respect or acknowledgement for yourself as you start to become more engaged and provide
      greater value. Just do great work. Find ways to provide more value where it is needed but which no one
      is offering. Share credit enthusiastically, and always keep your eyes ahead, focused on future projects
      and solutions, instead of past problems and histories of failure.</p>
