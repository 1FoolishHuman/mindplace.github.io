    <main>
      <p>I spent today completely rehauling the HTML on my personal site.
      Originally my blog landing page and post template looked like this:</p>
      
      <p><img src="imgs/wireframe-blog-index.jpg" width="30%">
          <img src="imgs/wireframe-blogs.jpg" width="30%"></p>
      
      <p>I thought I'd have a nice visible navbar on the side, variety of links,
      filling up the page in this lovely manner.</p>
      
      <p>Then I saw <a href="http://www.kerrisongarcia.com/">Kerrison Garcia's</a> 
      About Me page, and I immediately became extremely angry with myself.</p>
      
      <p><i>I'm a minimalist!</i> I shouted at myself. <i>I love things like this 
      <a href="http://zenhabits.net/">Zen Habits</a> site!</i> How many times do I need
      to read and reread <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-Decluttering/dp/1607747308">The
      Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up</a></i> in order to practice the minimalism I choose?!
      It's not like it's an onerous choice, since the less there is of something
      the more profoundly I love and enjoy it. When am I going to learn?</p>
      
      <p>Not to mention, why was I going to try to make so many visually complex elements
      that would probably require a lot of CSS to make them beautiful, when I already know
      that I am not passionate about the way things appear on the page and prefer the back-end
      side of web development? Setting aside the question of effort, wouldn't this send 
      an incorrect message to my prospective employers, the intended eventual audience for this site?</p>
      
      <p>So I ended up revamping my entire site. And I am feeling a lot better for it. There's a 
      much clearer and cleaner hierarchy of pages now. It's more obvious what I need to flesh out,
      like my Contact Me page, and I am feeling a lot more comfortable with how my site is going 
      to appear visually. I still need to work out the way I intend elements to look on the page
      and I am actually looking forward to doing that.</p>
