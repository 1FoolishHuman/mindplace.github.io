    <h1>1.7 Technical Blog: Reflection</h1>

      <p>
        This is the first blog post of what will be the basis of a technical blog. 
        Today's post has to do with the value of version control and using git and Github.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What are the benefits of version control?</b> Version control makes it possible for developers
        to generate a history of their projects or project files in a way that allows them to return to a 
        previous point in that history. Version control also allows developers to make copies of the master 
        file(s) in order to make changes or additions without breaking the master code and interrupting 
        potential user experience. Version control makes it possible for developers to share the creation process
        with other developers or support individuals, by allowing everyone to have a distinct
        copy or version of the code or project. This is all made possible by the fact that version control
        systems are designed to 
        easily merge changes and updates. This can decentralize project control to some extent, but primarily in 
        positive ways: by not forcing a single person or a small group of people to be solely responsible
        and liable for the integrity of the master file(s), by not interrupting the use of the current project
        in order to add features, and by ensuring that there is a single master file that is fully up-to-date
        and as bug-free as possible.

        <b>How does git help you keep track of changes?</b> git helps developers keep track of changes by 
        being a widely available and acessible command line-based version control program. Initializing git 
        in any folder and following file saving workflows--committing changes and keeping files and versions
        consistent--allows users to generate an ongoing history of the project. This fantastic visibility 
        on changes helps projects stay pertinent, ongoing, and easily update-able. git is arguably the 
        most well-used version control system on local computers, because it is powerful, simple, reliable, and
        doesn't discriminate against any file formats. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Why use GitHub to store your code?</b> Github is a clouded--non-local, Internet-accessible, remote--
        service that syncs up with your local computer and git-initialized folders to allow you to store and 
        create files and repositories in the cloud. This really quadruples the functionality git alreday offers
        you by making it possible to share repositories and files amongst your various computers and amongst your 
        collaborators or team members. Github allows all permissible users to view, fork (copy), and pull (store) 
        code and folders to their Github accounts and local computers. Because of this awesome functionality,
        Github is also the world's leading store of Open Source projects.
