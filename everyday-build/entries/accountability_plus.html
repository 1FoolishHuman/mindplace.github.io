    <p class="headings"><i>Added a feature where the program offers to let user tweet about their success with their accountability score.</i></p>
    
    <p>A few weeks ago I wrote a nifty little program to help me track whether I was meeting daily accountability
    goals. I had a vague idea that I was meeting my daily goals but I was frustrated that I couldn't find an app
    solution that would basically present me with the same accountability questions every day and record my answers,
    so that I could check how I was doing over time. So I wrote one instead, and you can check it out 
    <a href="https://github.com/mindplace/nifty_things/tree/master/Accountability_checklist">here</a>.</p>
    <p>The daily checklist reflects on the day so that I can get a feeling of clarity about what I did today, and 
    whether what I did was up to scratch. I built the app with the ability to use the everyday data to create tables and track progress,
     both overall and with specific elements of the checklist. That, plus the fact that the program exports data into and out of files and tracks it, makes 
     it a pretty nifty little useful thing for me.</p>
    <p>Today I added a new feature to this project, which allows the user to tweet about their 
    successes for the day. It was a very simple addition:</p>
    <p><img src="../imgs/ask_if_tweet.jpg"></p>
    <p><img src="../imgs/send_tweet.jpg"></p>
    <p>I struggled with the program trying to open an authentication page in the browser--something that 
    my setup won't allow me to do, because I'm using Cloud9, a clouded VM--before I realized I could 
    bypass the problem if I assume that I'll always be the user when running this file in my own repo, 
    so I could just save my twitter yml file in the same folder for it to access; it ran beautifully after that.</p>
