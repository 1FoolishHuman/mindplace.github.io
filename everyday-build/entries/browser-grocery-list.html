    <p>My cohort is preparing for week 1 in Phase 1 as of next week, and it's all review this week.
      As part of that, I thought I would try branching out into using JavaScript in the browser. Here's
      a grocery list function that works, rather annoyingly, through pop-ups, alerting and prompting
      the user to the state of their grocery list.</p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/99027193d2cf15a319034d204c277133.js"></script>
    <p>The more I work with JavaScript, the more irritating I find it. For example, when I tried running this
      script in the command line just to see if there were any syntax errors that I hadn't caught
      by eye, it refused to move past what I swear was a made-up error at line 2, which
      had not thrown an error previously, nor threw an error when I gave up and ran the code in
      the browser console directly. I keep having these struggles with JavaScript over what looks
      like absolutely nothing. I hope we come to terms with one another soon.</p>

    <p>That said, I was able to get a little more clarity in working with strings, objects, and
      loops in JavaScript, allowing for this second iteration to be a better laid out
      program.
