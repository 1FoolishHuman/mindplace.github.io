    <p>Whew! Just finished it! This is a little command-line game in JavaScript that
    generates a castle and, over the next '5 days', has random potential denizens show up, who
    do or do not end up staying for good. If enough good additions stay in the castle, the user
    wins--else, the user gets rudely booted from their castle, never to return! Here's some sample
    output:</p>

    <p>The most difficult issue I had to overcome with this game was the fact that JavaScript (for
      very good reasons) doesn't have the kind of sleep functionality that I've come to rely on with
      Ruby. I had to find a workaround on StackOverflow which I do not think I would be able to
      write myself at this point. Additionally, the other thing that gave me trouble was generating
      random numbers, especially those in a specific range. This was a frustrating exercise in
      trying to get the <code>Math.random()</code> to output something I actually was able to use, as
      opposed to a decimal.

    <p>Enough griping! Here's the code!</p>
