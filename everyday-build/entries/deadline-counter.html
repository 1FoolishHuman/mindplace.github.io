    <p>I wanted to spend a bit of time getting familiarized with the built-in <code>Date</code> and <code>Time</code>
    classes, so I decided to build a deadline counter that counted the days left until a given deadline. After requiring <code>Date</code>
    and spending some time browsing its methods, I realized it would be easy to create a new deadline date by calling 
    <code>Date.new</code> and passing it the arguments year, month, and day. My method turned out to be a lot shorter than I anticipated, 
    which I think really speaks to the awesome built-ins that Ruby ships with:</p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/76ea496a6d4ba299ed19.js"></script>
    <p>Nevertheless I was a bit taken aback by how easy that turned out to be, so I decided to kick it up a notch and write another 
    deadline counter: student edition! When the clock starts ticking, students don't think in terms of days as much as hours. For that, I needed to rely more on the <code>Time</code>
    class. Here it is:</p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/03d310c111b873a3d249.js"></script>
    <p>A bit longer, this one! Still, Ruby built-ins made the logic simple. The only extra came 
    when I realized I needed to create a helper method <code>military</code> to change hours into military time for the 
    <code>deadline_hour_counter</code> method.</p>
