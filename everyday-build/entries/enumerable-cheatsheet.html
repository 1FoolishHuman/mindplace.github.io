    <p>Today's post is a cheatsheet I did for week 8 of Dev Bootcamp. We're coming up quickly
    now onto Phase1, the intense on-campus immersive phase, and we're all preparing ourselves
    and our Ruby skills for that. This week was an introduction to SQL and some work in
    JavaScript, Ruby, and HTML/CSS. Here's the page I made:
  </p>
    <p><img src="../imgs/enumerable-cheatsheet.png" width="100%"></p>
    <p>I struggled for a very long time with the footer. I couldn't figure out how to have
      it stick to the bottom even if the page contents weren't enough to push it there naturally.
      In the end I couldn't figure it out and I shrugged my shoulders and fixed the rest of it
      to my liking. I'm going to bring it up to a friend at bootcamp who has CSS experience.
      In the meantime, I'm enjoying my other design choices.
