    <p>I was rereading Paul Ford's amazing essay <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/">"What Is Code?"</a>
    yesterday when it mentioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm">Euclid's algorithm</a>,
    one of the oldest algorithms still commonly in use today. It is a way to find the GCD of two numbers (greatest common divisor) and
    it does it like so:</p>
    <p>1. Take 2 numbers<br>2. The greater number modulo the smaller number equals the remainder<br>
    3. If the remainder is not 0, the smaller number becomes the new greater number and remainder becomes the new smaller number<br>
    4. Do steps 1 - 3 for as many times as you need to in order to get a remainder that is equal to 0<br>
    5. At that point, return the most recent smaller number.</p>
    <p>I appreciated the recursive nature of this lovely little algorithm and decided to
    try it out and practice my recursion skills, all at the same time:</p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/8fde7031305c98b6bcde.js"></script>
    <p>It can still be shortened, but it's short enough and simple enough already so
    why make it complicated by trying to oversimplify? The only issue I ran into was that
    I wasn't clear on which number I was supposed to return, but after rewatching
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJn843kplDw">this visual tutorial</a> everything eventually clicked for me.</p>
