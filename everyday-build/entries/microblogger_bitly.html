      <h3 class="headings">New MicroBlogger feature: Bitly link shortener</h3>
      <h4 class="headings">February 18, 2016</h4>
      <p class="headings"><i>Added a feature where the bitly gem automatically shortens any links.</i></p>
    <p>This was a project to add a feature to my <a href="microblogger.html">MicroBlogger</a> client. 
      It uses the Bitly gem to shorten links automatically by recognizing 'http' and 'www'. Here's 
      the code:</p>
    <p><img src="../imgs/bitly.jpg"></p>
    <p>This was its own little challenge. First I had to understand why Bitly.new required two
    arguments, and after a bit of researching realized those were the API authenticators, so I 
    set up my own. Then, because I'm rusty, I forgot that #select returns an array; I kept having errors 
    because I tried to feed Bitly the urls as an array. Then there was the 
    challenge of having multiple urls in a tweet because I only realized 
    belatedly that this wouldn't support having more than one url in a tweet.</p>
    <p>Finally I had a problem when I didn't realize that the gem couldn't recognize
    a link if it didn't come with 'http' or 'https' in front of it, so I had to 
    fix that.</p>
    <p>It took time to work through each bug, but it was all worth it to see the bitly-shortened link popping up in my
    Twitter feed.</p>
