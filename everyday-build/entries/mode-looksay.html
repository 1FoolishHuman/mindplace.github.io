    <p>Working through another set of small algorithmic challenges in order to bootstrap my JavaScript
      literacy! Today's problems include a pretty long solution to finding the mode in a given array,
      and the Look-Say sequence.</p>
    <p><b>Mode.</b> This problem gave me, well, problems. I used a JavaScript object like a hash to
      store values, but getting them back was messy as I'm still unused to the syntax. In the end
      it was a long, drawn-out affair in three parts: generating a hash of the given numbers with their
      respective counts, determining the element with the highest count, and generating a new array
      containing the numbers whose counts were equal to the highest count.</p>

    <p><b>Look-Say Sequence.</b> The idea for this one is for the program to look at a given number,
      extract it from the series, and record how many times it is repeated. So the number 1 returns
      11, because there was one 1 in the original number; the number 338862222 returns two 3s, two 8s,
      one 6, and four 2s, or 23281642.</p>

    <p>Doing these kinds of algorithms all week has really helped me to get comfortable with JavaScript,
      I think. It's how I initially learned Ruby: first learn enough syntax to solve algorithms, then
      solve a whole bunch of them, then read textbooks to understand what is happening and what else
      I should think about to start building on top of the small but stable amount of knowledge that I
      have. I read somewhere about a dev who has a series of go-to challenges for solving when learning
      new languages, and although I originally thought that something like that wouldn't be enough, now
      it feels a bit different.</p>
