      <p class="headings"><i>Writing out some Array methods from scratch.</i></p>
      <br />
      <p><img class="image-right" src="../imgs/my-each.png">One of the things 
      I've had to do on the road towards Ruby competency 
        has been to write my own versions of array methods from scratch. 
        I ended up reusing them quite often before I realized that the classes
        I was making could be subsumed into Array or Hash or whatnot as 
        required...but at least I got lots of experience. </p>
      <p>In order to write these, I had to think from a very different 
      perspective: one of creation moreso than use. I had to think in terms 
      of future use of this code, rather than trying to get it to produce
      something for me in the moment. That was a really interesting and important
      conceptual switchover for me, and I hope I keep it, because it 
      feels more rigorous.</p>
      <p><img class="image-right" src="../imgs/my-map-select.png">
      It was a huge struggle
      to conceptualize how these methods worked under the hood, and I had 
      to strengthen both my knowledge of Procs and self in order to do 
      it. </p>
      <p>Writing out #my_each was the biggest hurdle; after that, I could 
      piggy-back off of it to write #my_each and #my_select methods.</p>
      <p>Next hurdle will be to write out all the different kinds of sorting
      algorithms. Computer Science 101, but for me, it will probably be a revelation.</p>
