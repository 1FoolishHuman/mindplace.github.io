    <h3 class="headings">March 28, 2016</h3>

    <p>Before I started Dev Bootcamp, one of the ways I prepared myself was by spending
      quite a lot of time solving various challenges, and it wasn't long before I came accross
      <a href="https://projecteuler.net/archives">Project Euler</a>. I wasn't able to get too far
      with them, maybe only the first dozen or so, as the difficulty curve rose really quickly for me,
      and my 3 levels of Calculus in college weren't coming back to me at all easily.</p>
    <p>One of the most memorable challenges I did for Project Euler was finding the sums of all
      the prime numbers below 2 million. This was a difficult problem for me because my
      brute-force solution--checking each
      consecutive number for primeness by taking its factors--was just incredibly slow, and therefore
      disqualified as a solution. (And by slow I mean it would have taken days.) I finally caved in
      and created a sieve of Eratosthenes as StackOverflow commentors suggested. To do that, I spent
      quite a lot of time staring at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">the
      lovely animation on the Wikipedia page</a> for the sieve. I understood that the sieve didn't
      check for primeness; it instead assumed that multiples of given nums were already not going to be
      prime. Thanks to that, I finally came up with my solution for the prime problem:</p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/cf2c73c507b7711cd22d.js"></script>
      <p>I was so very proud of this solution. It's short, easy on computational load, and is optimized
        by the way it uses squares: it starts resetting multiples from the square of the current num,
        and breaks as soon as the square of the current num exceeds the length of the range. I'm happy with
        this solution! So a few months later, I decided to implement the sieve in JavaScript as well,
        except this one is meant to find the nth prime:</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/ad2d6dd52d89e32f6813.js"></script>
      <p>First off, the JavaScript solution is much more verbose; to do things like populate the initial
        range, or to find the next larger number to be the current num, it takes more lines and more
        words to do so. But even in JavaScript it is an elegant solution that is much shorter and simpler
        than it could otherwise be. So I think I can count myself as still happy with it.</p>
