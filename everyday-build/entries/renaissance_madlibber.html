    <p>In my pre-Ruby lifetime, I happened to acquire 2 degrees in English literature.
    The latter one of these was in the exciting field of Renaissance and Early Modern Studies, 
    and I spent most of my time working through late Medieval texts, both pre- and 
    post-Chaucer. Among the many other things I learned about English history, bookmaking,
    and culture, I learned that there's tons of humor both in the texts of this period
    as well as created by the researchers that work in it. One of my favorites was 
    Brantley L. Bryant, who wrote a wonderful blog called, appropriately, <a href="http://houseoffame.blogspot.com/">Geoffrey Chaucer
    Hath A Blog</a>. If you know your way around Middle English, it's hilarious!</p>
    <p>In honor of the fact that I'm spending this weekend at the one of my favorite Renaissance faires,
    I wrote a Renaissance-ish verbal adventure in Ruby (and I'm enough of a dork
    that I'm still laughing to myself about it). Here it is.</p>

    <p>Ok, let's run it! First, the script welcomes you:</p>
    <p><img src="../imgs/asking-for-name.jpg"></p>
    <p>All quiet on the Western front so far...</p>
    <p><img src="../imgs/offers-options.jpg"></p>
    <p>Someone offers you a choice between pirates, knightes, and singeres? Let's try pirates!</p>
    <p><img src="../imgs/pirates.jpg"></p>
    <p>How insulting! Ah well, let's try those minstrels out!</p>
    <p><img src="../imgs/singeres.jpg"></p>
    <p>Methinks at this point you can probably tell I'm a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071853/"><i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</i></a> fan.</p>
    <p>That's it for today! I'll be adding knightes soon!</p>
