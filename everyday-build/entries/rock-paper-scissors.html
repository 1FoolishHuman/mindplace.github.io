    <p>I've looked at some tutorials on making small games with JavaScript and it seems
    that you could make a JavaScript game run in the browser with basically nothing more 
    than some HTML5. That's pretty nifty. I don't feel ready for that conceptual leap though yet, 
    maybe tomorrow. Today, as part of my self-challenges to get my JavaScript up to code (ahem),
    here's a lovely Rock-Paper-Scissors game.</p>

    <p>I've understood that JavaScript objects can function like hashes in other languages, 
    with accessibility and everything. And using for loops works fine for accessing them iteratively.
    But I miss my Ruby string interpolation. (Among a whole ton of other functionality. Sigh.)</p>
