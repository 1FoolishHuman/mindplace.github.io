    <p>I've gone through a few good resources on bash/shell commands,
    trying to get comfortable with the command line interface, but I wasn't 
    quite feeling comfortable still. One of my Dev Bootcamp guides suggested that 
    I try writing a shell script as a way to get a bit better. So I wrote one that 
    checks first for whether it's been passed any arguments. If it doesn't get any,
    it prints out instructions for the user; if it does get some, it checks whether each 
    argument is a software that is installed, and prints out whatever it finds.</p>
    <p>There were a few stuggles and a few very interesting moments with this project. 
    For one thing, I already knew a bit about ARGVs and could assume that a shell script 
    could recognize and iterate over an array. I also assumed that there was some way 
    to create a conditional flow. Both of these assumptions helped a lot with googling for the commands. 
    I found <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_07_01.html">this 
    awesome resource</a> and used it as a command cheatsheet. I decided to use this one
    to test if ARGVs were empty:</p>
    <p><img src="../imgs/bash-command.jpg"></p>
    <p>That's where my confusion, still unresolved, comes in. I passed it $@, or
    what I understand is the ARGV array, and expected that [ -s $@ ] would fail because
    an empty array does not have a size greater than zero. But instead it works, and prints
    the following instructions only if the ARGV array has a size equal to zero! So I remain 
    confused.</p>
    <p>Still it did the trick--writing this script definitely helped me get greater
    confidence with writing shell commands! And I now have a much deeper respect and 
    appreciation for Unix...</p>
