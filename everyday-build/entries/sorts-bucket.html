    <p>I started off not really understanding how bucket sort works; the concept of partitioning
      items by placing them into different buckets made sense, but what is the way in which the
      program decides on bucket sizes? I couldn't understand the logic even when I looked at
      examples of others' bucket sorts. So I decided to design my solution in a way that didn't
      pre-make buckets before partitioning. Instead, it sends items to their corresponding indexes--so
      66 would be sent to <code>bucket[66]</code>, etc.</p>

    <p>Does this still count as a bucket sort? Is this an example of another type of sorting
      algorithm? It makes sense and seems to be optimized for speed, as claiming new slots in
      an existing array should be faster than doing calculations to figure out where an item should go. Either way, it's simple and it works, so it's satisfying enough, even if it
      isn't an actual bucket sort.</p>
