    <p>I made <a href="tea_site.html">a little mock-up of for my tea site</a> a few weeks ago
    and finally sat down to make it. But of course in the time between then and now, my ideas
    and design taste changed, and I was thoroughly motivated to learn about how to use options like 
    <code>float</code>, <code>display: inline-block;</code>, and most of all, <code>box-sizing: border-box</code>.
    The site's HTML is <a href="https://github.com/mindplace/mindplace.github.io/blob/master/tea-site/tea-site.html">here</a>, 
    and CSS is <a href="https://github.com/mindplace/mindplace.github.io/blob/master/tea-site/tea-site.css">here</a>, see 
    the site for yourself <a href="../tea-site/tea-site.html">here</a>. What the site now looks like:</p>
    <p><img src="../imgs/top-tea.png" width="100%"></p>
    <p>Middle:</p>
    <p><img src="../imgs/middle-tea.png" width="100%"></p>
    <p>Somewhere in the depths of the night, in a sugar-fueled haze, I decided I wanted pretty images 
    to grace my page, and floating images just by themselves, altering with text, wasn't at all
    the effect I wanted. So I found <a href="canva.com">Canva</a>, a site that lets you mix text, images.
    and shapes to make nice pleasing visual elements that look completely at home on someone's 
    Facebook feed. Here's my favorite one that I made:</p>
    <p><img src="../../tea-site/imgs/alice.png" width="100%"></p>
    <p>Quite right, Alice.</p>
    <p>(On a nerdy note, I chose that quote because it read like an array joke.)</p>
    <p>The top and bottom of the page gave me a chance to work on headers and footers that stick to the top and 
    bottom respectively and stretch the full width of the page. I think the footer turned out to be my favorite
    element:</p>
    <p><img src="../imgs/bottom-tea.png" width="100%"></p>
    <p>The site isn't really responsive, the items are really gigantic on my screen and take up a lot of 
    space generally, and the whole experience of it doesn't feel cohesive, but it was a great, really great 
    learning experience. I learned about making the navbar in a way that has the floating right element 
    positioned inside the rest of the floating left elements, which was really not at all intuitive. I learned about 
    visual design, a topic I really can't say I have much fondness for. I learned more than I think I could stomach
    about floating elements and trying to make them align.</p>
    <p>The next step would be to learn about JavaScribt by embedding some nice code to have that test work:</p>
