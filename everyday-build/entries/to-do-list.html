      <p>This is a classic program for many languages (much like building a blog seems to
      be a classic beginner's application in Rails) and I thought I'd give it a try and flex
      my I/O muscles.</p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/mindplace/6df4ca68f74397478811.js"></script>
      <p>The program initializes from the command line and prompts the user to input 
      items one a time. Once the user presses enter without inputting an item, the item-collection
      terminates, and offers to export the items into a text file. If this option is accepted, it 
      creates a new file relative to the script's location and sends items from the list array 
      one at a time into the new file; otherwise, it formats the items and prints them to the screen.</p>
      <p>Writing programs like these, I find myself focusing mostly on two things: <b>simplicity of 
      logic</b>--terse, DRY code, single-responsibility methods, etc--and <b>user experience</b>.</p>
      <p>My goal is always to anticipate how a user will use my program, even if I'm going to be the only user.
      I want to abstract all the 'thinking' to the program so that the user has a very clear sense of 
      their 'job' in interacting with the program. I think it's pretty useful to be thinking of user 
      experience even when writing such mini-programs, because a beautiful program is useless if it isn't 
      FOR anyone or anything, and it remains useless if it is difficult or uncomfortable to use--even 
      if it's able to offer a great deal of functionality or options.</p>
