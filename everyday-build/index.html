  <h3>The Concept</h3>
    <p>I was inspired by Kerrison Garcia, who posted on Reddit a while ago
      about how he wanted to learn more about Rails and had decided to do so
      by starting a <a href="http://www.yourrailsdaily.com/">Rails Daily newsletter</a>.
      He started the newsletter in the middle of a series of Rails projects,
      and it really impressed me: here was someone who was tackling their
      don't-know-enough problem simply by building more things. Lots of people
      talk about how this method, but it doesn't seem that many follow through.
    </p>
    <p>That's where my project was born. I am challenging myself to build something
      small every day, or showcase a small thing I've built previously, as a way
      to stay on top of my learning. I'm especially going to be focusing on
      Ruby and Rails.
