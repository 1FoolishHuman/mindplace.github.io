  <h3>The Project</h3>
  <p>This is a Ruby project from <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/">Jumpstart Labs</a>.
    I wanted to try building something to work on what I have learned: dynamic classes, IO,
    parsing data. The MicroBlogger tutorial seemed like it was right up my alley
    and was going to do something interesting and useful, too. Plus it gave me a chance to
    work with gems, something I've only ever done with RSpec before.</p>
  <p>It turned out to be a ton of fun. Using the jumpstart_auth gem felt like magic: I could
    ask it for things like a friend's last tweet and it would deliver it!</p>
  <p>I think my focus for this project, as much as it has been in the past, is the fluid
    flow between user interface and program. It is important to me that I build things that make
    sense under the hood in a way that keeps user needs at a forefront. In this case it meant
    thinking of basic design and additional features as modules that fit together but were also
    distinct from each other.</p>
  <p>I think the two most important things I've gotten to know better because of this project
    is the experience of using a gem and checking out its features, and the use and value of
    Ruby's #respond_to? and #send methods. Those were really useful in making the user interface
    code short and very easy to add more commands for the user and more modular-designed services
    in the program.</p>
