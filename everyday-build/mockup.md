### Everyday Build page mockup
#### Wireframe:
![page wireframe](/microblogger-imgs/wireframe-blog-index.jpg)
Same layout as my blog index: for visual and stylistic consistency. 

#### Mood board:
![page mood board](/microblogger-imgs/moodboard.jpg)
Mood board for the page, with some of the potential nav section backgrounds
and a potential color palette. 

#### Colors: 
[Color Palette](http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/1526244/Eastern_Wisdom)
- "Sumatra" (HEX: F56C0E)
- "Yangon" (HEX: E53900)
- "Kanpur" (HEX: A70F01)
- "Luang Prabang" (HEX: 0A3E56)
- "undertow" (HEX: 077876)
Ultimately I think my color palette will come from whichever navbar background
I end up choosing. 

#### Fonts:
For page text: [Source Sans Pro, normal 400](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
For titles: [Source Sans Pro, bold 700](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)

#### Notes:
- I see my page split into two visual areas: the main text area, with a white background 
and scrolling text, and the navbar area, with a picture background, that stays stationary 
while the user scrolls. 
- Navbar background potentials: [golden tree](https://unsplash.com/photos/naQdcC4nVgA),

I chose these stock images because I think the idea of a tree is perfect: I'll be a webdev sapling at the
end of DBC, with a lot of growth ahead of me, but rooted; and even old trees are always growing
and changing themselves to adapt to the environment. 
- Main area page titles should have a plain color background for the length of their line, 
one of the colors from my palette. 
- Invidual posts should have a picture icon next to the entry title, and that same 
image should be in the post itself.
