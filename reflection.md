**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?** 
I learned a huge amount of things by working on my own site's CSS. I learned to manipulate
padding, borders, and margins, and using Chrome's Dev tools I was able to see how 
padding sits inside margins. 

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**
I learned that positioning is a lot harder than I thought. First, I couldn't figure
out how to have an image appear inline with text. I struggled with different options
for hours until I threw my hands up and created a class that I added into the 
appropriate images to make them float to the right. Then I had the hardest time
trying to position images so that the box inside which the images were supposed
to be contained was large enough for them. In the end I learned about overflow: hidden;, and that
actually fixed everything! Along the way I also learned about how to fix padding and margins
on text areas, and was finally able to make headings visually sit closer to text and each 
other, which helped a lot. 

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**
Other than the image issues, one of the hardest things was learning to make the navbar
float on top. I still haven't fixed it properly but at least it's getting there. 
The very hardest thing I tried to do--which in the end I abandoned because I 
couldn't figure it out--was to make the text box background transparent. It worked
to get it transparent, but then I couldn't get the actual text and images to be 
opaque! 

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**
I don't think I can even ennumerate the things I've learned. Basically everything on my 
[index.css](https://github.com/mindplace/mindplace.github.io/blob/master/css/index.css) page
is 100% thanks to this challenge. I didn't know the first thing about CSS before this 
and learned everything just by trying to make my site appear the way I wanted it to.
