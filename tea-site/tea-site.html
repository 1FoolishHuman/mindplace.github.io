    <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Grey_tea">Earl Grey Tea</a></h2>
    <p>Earl Grey tea is a tea blend which has been flavored with the addition of oil of bergamot. 
    Traditionally, "Earl Grey" was made from black teas, but tea companies have since begun to offer 
    Earl Grey in other varieties as well, such as green or oolong.</p>
    <p>A 2010 survey found that a significant minority of people in the United Kingdom associate 
    drinking Earl Grey tea with being "posh" or upper class.</p>
    <p>Tea flavoured with bergamot to imitate the more expensive types of Chinese tea has been 
    known in England at least since the 1820s. In 1837 there is a record of court proceedings 
    against Brocksop & Co. who were found to have supplied tea "artificially scented, and, 
    drugged with bergamot in this country." A 'Grey's Tea' is known from the 1850s, but the 
    first known published references to an 'Earl Grey' tea are advertisements by Charlton & Co. 
    of Jermyn Street in London in the 1880s.</p>
    <p>The Earl Grey blend, or "Earl Grey's Mixture", is assumed to be named after Charles Grey, 
    2nd Earl Grey, British Prime Minister in the 1830s and author of the Reform Bill of 1832. 
    He reputedly received a gift, probably a diplomatic perquisite, of tea flavoured with bergamot oil.</p>
    <p>According to one legend, a grateful Chinese mandarin whose son was rescued from drowning 
    by one of Lord Grey's men first presented the blend to the Earl in 1803. The tale appears to 
    be apocryphal, as Lord Grey never set foot in China and the use of bergamot oil to scent tea was 
    then unknown in China. However, this tale is subsequently told (and slightly corrected) as on 
    the Twinings website, as "having been presented by an envoy on his return from China".</p>
    <p>Jacksons of Piccadilly claim they originated Earl Grey's Tea, Lord Grey having given the 
    recipe to Robert Jackson & Co. partner George Charlton in 1830. According to Jacksons, the 
    original recipe has been in constant production and has never left their hands. Theirs has 
    been based on Chinese black tea since the beginning.</p>
    <p>According to the Grey family, the tea was specially blended by a Chinese mandarin for Lord 
    Grey, to suit the water at Howick Hall, the family seat in Northumberland, using bergamot in 
    particular to offset the preponderance of lime in the local water. Lady Grey used it to entertain 
    in London as a political hostess, and it proved so popular that she was asked if it could be sold 
    to others, which is how Twinings came to market it as a brand.</p>
