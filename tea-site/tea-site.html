            <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Grey_tea">Earl Grey Tea</a></h2>
            <p>Earl Grey tea is a tea blend which has been flavored with the addition of oil of bergamot. 
            Traditionally, "Earl Grey" was made from black teas, but tea companies have since begun to offer 
            Earl Grey in other varieties as well, such as green or oolong.</p>
            <p>A 2010 survey found that a significant minority of people in the United Kingdom associate 
            drinking Earl Grey tea with being "posh" or upper class.</p>
            <p>Tea flavoured with bergamot to imitate the more expensive types of Chinese tea has been 
            known in England at least since the 1820s. In 1837 there is a record of court proceedings 
            against Brocksop & Co. who were found to have supplied tea "artificially scented, and, 
            drugged with bergamot in this country." A 'Grey's Tea' is known from the 1850s, but the 
            first known published references to an 'Earl Grey' tea are advertisements by Charlton & Co. 
            of Jermyn Street in London in the 1880s.</p>
